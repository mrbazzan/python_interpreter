    A PYTHON INTERPRETER

Python is a programming language while CPython is the primary
implementation of Python in C (and Python - yeah, I know).

A Python interpreter: an interpreter in the Python context
is a generic term. It could mean one of the following:
i) The Python REPL
ii) Running the Python code from start to finish.

In this mini-study, the term "INTERPRETER" focuses
on the final step in the execution of a Python program.

Before the interpreter assumes control; The lexer, parser,
and compiler acts on the source text to convert it to
structured code objects that contains instructions that the
interpreter understands.

NB: Python has a compiling step

The interpreter takes the code object and follows
the instructions.

NB: The compilation step in Python execution process does
relatively less work (the interpreter does more) than in a
compiled language.
