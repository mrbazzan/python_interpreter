    A PYTHON INTERPRETER

Python is a programming language while CPython is the primary
implementation of Python in C (and Python - yeah, I know).

A Python interpreter: an interpreter in the Python context
is a generic term. It could mean one of the following:
i) The Python REPL
ii) Running the Python code from start to finish.

In this mini-study, the term "INTERPRETER" focuses
on the final step in the execution of a Python program.

Before the interpreter assumes control; The lexer, parser,
and compiler acts on the source text to convert it to
structured code objects that contains instructions that the
interpreter understands.

NB: Python has a compiling step

The interpreter takes the code object and follows
the instructions.

NB: The compilation step in Python execution process does
relatively less work (the interpreter does more) than in a
compiled language.

    BUILDING THE INTERPRETER

Virtual machines are software that emulates physical
computer. The Python interpreter is a **virtual machine**
which works like a stack machine: it manipulates stack(s)
to perform its operations (as opposed to a register machine
which reads and write to a particular memory locations).

    why?

The interpreter is a bytecode interpreter. It takes
instruction sets called **bytecode** as input.

The lexer, parser, and compiler generate code objects.
Each code object contains a set of instructions to be
executed - bytecode - and other information that the
interpreter requires.

    code object = bytecode + other information

In building the interpreter, the operations are
represented as methods in an Interpreter class e.g
LOAD_VALUE, ADD_TWO_VALUES, PRINT_NUMBER etc. Each of
these operations act on a stack (represented as a list
object inside the interpreter).

LOAD_VALUE: adds element to the stack
ADD_TWO_VALUES: pops two elements from the stack, add them
                together and add the result to the stack
PRINT_NUMBER: pops an element from the stack, and prints
              the element.

  VARIABLES

Variables require an instruction for storing the value of
a variable, STORE_NAME; an instruction for retrieving the
value of a variable, LOAD_NAME; and a mapping of variable
names to values.

The mapping is achieved by defining an environment instance
variable - represented as a Python dictionary - on the
Interpreter class (this is a hack for now).

STORE_NAME: pops an element from the stack and store it on
            the environment variable with the appropriate key.
LOAD_NAME: given a key, get the associated value and add it
           to the stack
